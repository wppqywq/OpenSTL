# Baseline Simulation Experiment (Archived)

## Summary
This archived experiment conducted systematic baseline comparisons across multiple model variants for sparse video prediction. The experiment evaluated 9 different model configurations and identified the best performing approaches through pixel error analysis.

## Experiment Results

### Model Performance Ranking
Based on pixel error analysis (lower is better):

| Rank | Model | Pixel Error | Improvement vs Best |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1    | ultra_robust_model | 7.347 | 0.0% (baseline) |
| 2    | robust_simple_model | 7.347 | 0.0% (tie) |  
| 3-9  | All other variants | 8.413 | 14.5% worse |

### Key Findings
- **Top Performers**: Ultra-robust and robust-simple models achieved identical best performance
